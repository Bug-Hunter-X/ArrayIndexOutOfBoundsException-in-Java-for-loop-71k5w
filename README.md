# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The error occurs when trying to access an array element using an index that is out of the valid range (0 to array.length - 1).

The `bug.java` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.java` file shows the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of carefully checking loop conditions and array bounds when working with arrays in Java to avoid runtime exceptions.
